# What is CourseLaunch?

**CourseLaunch** is a command-line tool that turns a folder of markdown files into a complete, navigable course website — no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript required.

## The Problem It Solves

You've got notes. Maybe a Google Doc, a Notion page, or a pile of markdown files. You want to share them as a course, but:

- Platforms like Teachable are expensive and lock you in
- Building a site from scratch takes days
- Your content is more important than your web dev skills

CourseLaunch solves this by giving you a simple structure to follow and generating everything else automatically.

## What You Get

Running `courselaunch build` produces a fully self-contained static site:

- A landing page listing all your modules
- Individual module pages with lesson lists
- Full lesson pages with prev/next navigation
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks (via [Shiki](https://shiki.style))
- A responsive sidebar with mobile support
- Zero external dependencies — the output is just HTML and CSS

## Who It's For

- Independent educators publishing mini-courses
- Bootcamp instructors sharing course notes
- Workshop creators documenting hands-on labs
- Anyone who writes in markdown and wants to share it nicely

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll install CourseLaunch and create your first course project.
